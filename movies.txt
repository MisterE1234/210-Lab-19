Loved it. Can't wait to see more.
It was good but needed work.
It's a sure oscar winner.
The concept is facinating, but the movie needed a bigger budget to really capture it.
A wild wonder land!
The main character needed slight work.
A great proof of concept.
An amazing music score!
Would watch again.
It is a fun movie to watch with pals.
I need to see more of the story's world.
Another great classic.
